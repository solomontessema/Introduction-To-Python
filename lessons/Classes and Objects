## Classes & Objects

This lesson includes a hands-on coding exercise. After reviewing the material below, please open the lab assignment using the link below:

Classes and objects are the foundation of object-oriented programming (OOP), a powerful way to model real-world systems in code. In Python, classes let you define reusable templates for things — like users, products, or tasks — while objects are individual instances of those templates.

For non-technical leaders, understanding classes and objects helps clarify how software systems are structured, how data is organized, and how behaviors are encapsulated.

### **Why Classes Matter**

Classes help you:

- Group related data and actions together  
- Create reusable components across projects  
- Model real-world entities like customers or orders  
- Improve clarity and maintainability in code  

They’re especially useful when building systems that involve many similar items with shared behavior.

### **What Are Objects?**

An object is a specific instance of a class. If a class is a blueprint, an object is the finished product. Each object can hold its own data and perform actions defined by the class.

For example, a class might define what a “Task” looks like, while each object represents a specific task with its own deadline and status.
