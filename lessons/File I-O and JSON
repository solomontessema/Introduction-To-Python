Python’s ability to read and write files is essential for working with real-world data. Whether you're handling reports, logs, or structured datasets, understanding file I/O (input/output) gives you control over how information flows in and out of your programs.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular format for storing structured data. It’s used in APIs, configuration files, and data exchanges between systems. Python makes it easy to read, write, and manipulate JSON — a key skill for leaders working with digital tools and platforms.

### **Why File I/O Matters**

File I/O allows you to:

- Save results from your analysis  
- Load data from spreadsheets or logs  
- Automate reporting and documentation  
- Archive information for future use  

It’s the bridge between your code and the outside world.

### **Why JSON Is Important**

JSON is ideal for:

- Storing structured data like user profiles or product info  
- Communicating with web services and APIs  
- Sharing data between systems in a standardized format  
- Making your programs interoperable and scalable  

For non-technical professionals, JSON is a readable way to understand how systems organize and exchange data.
